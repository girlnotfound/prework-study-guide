            <li>HTML,Hypertext Markup Language, is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and
            the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
            <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage such as: text elements, image elements, header elements, and list elements.</li>
            <li>HTML elements are composed of an opening and closing tag represented with angle brackets. These tags contain everything we want to include in the element. This can contain content and other nested elements.</li>
