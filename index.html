        <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and
            the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
            <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage such as: text elements, image elements, header elements, and list elements.</li>
            <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
            <li>HTML elements are composed of an opening and closing tag represented with angle brackets. 
              <ul>
                <li>These tags contain everything we want to include in the element. This can contain content and other nested elements.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>The head element contains information or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Elements included within the head are not visible when the user looks at a webpage.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt; &lt;h5&gt; and &lt;h6&gt; are visible elements that represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Use heading tags in order from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</li>
            <li>The &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
            <li>&lt;ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;li&gt; are elements which represent unordered(bulleted) lists, ordered(numbered) lists, and list items.</li>
            <li>The &lt;img&gt; element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
            <li>The &lt;br&gt; element creates a line of empty space, or a line break between two blocks of content</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to define the color, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization of a webpage. CSS is used to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options. </li>
            <li>CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. CSS rules contain a selector and a declaration</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Selectors indicates which element the rule applies to.</li>
                <li>Declarations indicate how the element referred to in the selector should be styled.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and are made up of a property and a value.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Properties indicate aspects of the element you want to change.</li>
                <li>Values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, specifying a color propery, the value is the color you want the text in the element to be. </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Examples of CSS properties include:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>margin, which indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
                <li>padding, which indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>We can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a
            class selector.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, and allowing you to reference them as needed.</li>
            <li>A Git project can be thought of as having three parts.</li>
              <ol>
                <li>A Working Directory: where you will be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files.</li>
                <li>A Staging Area: where you will list changes you make to the working directory.</li>
                <li>A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project.</li>
              </ol>
            <li>Git commands to use to help keep track of changes made to a project: (note: the git command must precede every git statement)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently in.</li>
                <li>git add: adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
                <li>git add -A: to stage all changes in the repository.</li>
                <li>git add commit -m: to create a new commit with the changes that have been added to the staging area. The -m is followed by a message in quotes describing what changes the commit contains.</li>
                <li>git pull origin branch-name: is used to fetch changes from a remote repository's branch and merge them into your current branch.  </li>
                <li>git push origin branch-name: is used to upload the local repository content to a remote repository.</li>
                <li>git checkout: to move from the working branch to a new branch.</li>
                <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
