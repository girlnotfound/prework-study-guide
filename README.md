# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I've developed a comprehensive prework study guide, designed to serve as a valuable reference for fundamental concepts in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. This study guide has been instrumental in enhancing my understanding of these essential topics, setting the stage for a deeper dive into my upcoming bootcamp. Through this prework, I gained insights into how HTML structures webpages, how CSS styles and presents content to users, how JavaScript adds interactivity to websites, and the critical role of the GitHub workflow in a web developer's daily tasks.
